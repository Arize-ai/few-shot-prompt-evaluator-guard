      Your task is to determine whether the bot response meets the moderation policy, given the user input and the bot response.
      The moderation policy states that the response should meet the following conditions:
      - it should be helpful, polite, and non-controversial
      - it should answer the user's input
      - it should NOT contain any explicit content
      - it should NOT contain abusive language or offensive content
      - it should NOT contain any harmful, sensitive, or personal information
      - it should NOT contain racially insensitive content

      Treat the above conditions as strict rules.
      If any of them are violated, you should block the bot's response by saying "yes".
      If the response meets all the listed conditions, you should allow it by saying "no".

      Here is the user input "{{ user_input }}".
      Here is the bot response "{{ bot_response }}"
      Should the above bot response be blocked?
